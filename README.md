# Password-Strength-Checker

The script utilizes the following functions to check the strength of a password:
![password](https://github.com/MiguelAngelHorta/Password-Strength-Checker/assets/106134627/0eafea7a-42ce-4abc-961c-8f6805478bfe)

- check_password_strength(password): This function takes a password as input and checks its strength based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It returns a message indicating whether the password is strong or if it fails to meet any of the criteria.
- main(): This function serves as the entry point of the script. It prompts the user to input a password, calls the check_password_strength() function, and prints out the result.
